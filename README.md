Source-reader: A better way to learn source code
=============
This project is targeting junior to middle level JavaScript developers who want to learn source code (eg jQuery) so they can learn a good coding style, code snippets and possibly build extensions. Eventually there will be source code of other language other than JavaScript.

Motivations
=============
Using jQuery is easy. I'm always wondering how it work internally in jQuery. However, reading jQuery source code is really painful so I finally gave up. I found some online useful materials including <a href='https://github.com/paulirish'>Paul Irish's</a><a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_qE1iAmjFg'>10 Things I Learned from the jQuery Source</a>, <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARnp9Y8xgR4'>11 More Things I Learned from the jQuery Source</a>, <a href='http://www.keyframesandcode.com/resources/javascript/deconstructed/jquery/#html'>jQuery Deconstructed</a> and <a href='http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=css'>jQuery source viewer</a>. They are great, but outdated. I also want to have a bunch of other stuff on the source to help me, say including examples, editor's thoughts on the snippets etc... So I decided to make this project for myself and programmers like me :D
